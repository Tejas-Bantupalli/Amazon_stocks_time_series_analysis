In this report, we conducted an analysis of Amazon's stock price data from 2015 to the present. We started with data exploration and summary statistics, which provided insight into the range and distribution of stock prices. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test indicated that the data is non-stationary (as p>0.5), which is a critical consideration when working with time series.

We used the Prophet model to forecast future stock prices and generate predictions for the next 30 days. The resulting visualizations show both the forecasted values and the actual historical prices, providing a clear understanding of the trends and patterns.

The evaluation metrics—Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE)—offer quantitative assessments of the model's performance, highlighting its predictive accuracy, due to their relatively low values. While these results are promising, it's important to recognize that forecasting stock prices is still uncertain due to the influence of numerous external factors.

Overall, this analysis provides an understanding of Amazon's stock price dynamics and demonstrates the application of time series forecasting techniques.
